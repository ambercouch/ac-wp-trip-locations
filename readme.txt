Shortcode to display posts in content areas.

== Description ==

A simple Wordpress plugin that creates Wordpress shortcode that will loop through posts, pages, or custom post types and display them on your website or blog. A typical use would be to show your latest post on your homepage.

== Installation ==

Use WordPress' Add New Plugin feature, searching "AC custom loop", or download the archive and:

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/ac-wp-custom-loop` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Add the shortcode [ac_custom_loop] to the content area of any page, post or custom post type or to any widget that supports shortcode.
4. By default the shortcode will display your latest 4 post, you can use the 'type' and 'show' arguments to customise the type of post that are shown and how many eg. [ac_custom_loop type="page" show="3"] would show the last three published pages.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
